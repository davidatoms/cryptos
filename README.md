Columbia Data Analytics Boot Camp - Module 18 - Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies - Used unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency data.

## What I Learned/Achieved:
- How to describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each.
- How to preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
- How to cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
- How to determine the best amount of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
- How to use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.
